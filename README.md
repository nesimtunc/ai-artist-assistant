# AI Artist Assistant

AI Artist Assistant is an open-source project aimed at building a community-driven platform for generating lyrics, songs, and potentially enabling chat functionality with famous artists and individuals who have passed away. The project is designed to be generic and adaptable, allowing it to be used with any artist or person for whom there is sufficient data.

This repository contains the code and resources for the AI models, fine-tuning, and content generation, focusing on integrating with state-of-the-art AI models and APIs to generate lyrics, songs, and potential chat functionality.

**For the web platform and community interaction, check out the [ai-artist-assistant-web repository](https://github.com/nesimtunc/ai-artist-assistant-web).**
